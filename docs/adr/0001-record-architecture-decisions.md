# ADR-0001: Record architecture decisions

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Design decisions were previously recorded only in PR bodies and commit
messages — they are hard to discover and do not survive squashed history.

## Decision

Every significant architectural decision is recorded as an ADR under
`docs/adr/NNNN-<slug>.md`, numbered sequentially, written in
Context / Decision / Consequences form with OKF v0.2 YAML frontmatter
(`type: ADR`). Design docs live under `docs/design/` with the same
frontmatter convention. Both are updated in the same commit as the change
they describe.

## Consequences

- Decisions are discoverable and reviewable alongside the code.
- Small documentation overhead per change; the rule is enforced by
  `AGENTS.md`/`CONTRIBUTING.md`.
