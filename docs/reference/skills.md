# Agent Skills

Skills live canonically in `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. Codex, Devin,
and Antigravity read `.agents/skills` natively; Claude Code sees the same
set via the `.claude/skills` symlink.

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `worktreeharness-development` | Development workflow for the Worktreeharness repository itself: the orchestrator creates a worktree under `worktree/` and works in it directly — implement, commit, push, open a PR. |
| `worktree-development` | Orchestrator mode for every other repository: confirm agent kind + repo with the user, then dispatch via `spawn-repo-agent.sh` — a single call that goes all the way to a spawned worker in a fresh detached task worktree (one workspace per repo, one tab per task; task text optional — an idle spawn gets a standby prompt and is tasked later). Never stops at bare worktree creation; reports to the user in natural language, never raw commands to run. See `orchestration.md`. |
| `git-operations` | Git discipline for harness development only: clone via `gh`, branch from latest `main`, commit/PR conventions, PATCH-based PR edits. Used from `worktreeharness-development`. |
| `workflow-shell-test` | Extract testable shell logic from GitHub Actions workflows and cover it with BATS. |

## Design intent

Skills encode *procedures* the orchestrator follows; they assume the
calling agent already sits at the lab root. A dispatched worker does **not**
receive these skills — it only sees the target repo's own `AGENTS.md`,
`.agents/skills`, and conventions.

## Frontmatter

Skills carry only `name` + `description`. `allowed-tools` is
deliberately unset: the spec field is experimental and tool
vocabularies/semantics differ per agent — Claude treats it as per-turn
pre-approval (not a restriction), Devin accepts a small lowercase tool
set, Antigravity uses its own `tools:` field, and Codex ignores
everything past `name`/`description`. Any restriction enforcement lives
in the guard hooks, not in skill metadata.
